
A buzzing swarm of flies.

Load "Swarm_Of_Flies.unity" for an example scene, or simply drag the required swarm size from the Prefabs folder (in the Project window) into the Hierarchy window.

Note you can also scale each swarm by altering the size of its parent node (making the flies swarm in a larger or smaller area).

Have fun!
